AngioScope: AI-Enhanced Smart Stethoscope for Blood Vessel Blockage Detection

------------------------------
ABSTRACT
------------------------------

We propose an electronic stethoscope, AngioScope, designed to identify blood vessel blockages as a low-cost, non-invasive alternative to conventional angiography. Our method leverages extensive research done to detect cardiovascular disease (CVD) using heart sound analysis.
Our unique and innovative method is to apply audio processing techniques to analyze heart sound in combination with machine learning to diagnose blood vessel blockages with significant precision. This will allow general practitioners to make confident medical decisions without the use of conventional angiograms. Currently, there are numerous electronic stethoscopes in the market but without any diagnostic capability.
The proposed method involves an electronic chest piece that converts heart vibrations to a digitally encoded signal using transducers such as microphones or acclerometers. Digital signal processing (DSP) hardware will be used to extract unique spectral features from patient heart sounds. Then a trained Convlutional Neural Network (CNN) digital hardware is used to detect blockages by recognizing unique spectral signatures. The result will then be displayed locally on a small display on the stethoscope and transmitted wirelessly using the Bluetooth or WiFi protocol.

Our method of implementation involves first building a model in the Python programming language. A machine learning model is used to train the model with a large dataset of heart sounds from the 2016 Challenge Database of PhysioNet Computational Cardiology (CinC). This has been implemented and the trained model shows 92% accuracy in detecting blockages in blood vessels, proving the feasibility of the proposed solution. This validated model will be implemented on a ESP32 Node MCU or a Raspberry Pi Zero to demonstrate the viability of the proposed solution. In the process of implementation, the architecture will be significantly optimized to use minimal hardware to implement the solution.

1. PROBLEM STATEMENT
------------------------------

Prob. Stmnt ID: 1547: Development of an alternative technology to check blockage of blood vessels (an alternative to conventional angiography)

Background: Angiography is a common medical imaging technique that is used to visualize the interior of blood vessels and detect blockages.

Description: However, typically medical tests like radionuclide angiography involve the use of radioactive contrast agents, which can pose risks to patients, including radiation exposure and allergic reactions. There is a growing need for safer, non-invasive alternatives that can provide accurate diagnostics without these risks.

Expected Solution: The problem statement is to develop a cost-effective, non-invasive technology that can accurately detect blockages in blood vessels without the use of radioactive materials. This technology should be suitable for widespread clinical use and provide reliable results comparable to conventional angiography.

------------------------------
2. PROBLEM BACKGROUND
------------------------------
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cardiovascular disease (CVD) caused by narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries due to atherosclerotic plaque, leading to possible ischemia, angina, heart attacks, and heart failure. CVD is a major contributor to heart-related deaths and is projected to have a large impact on global mortality rates by 2030 [1]. Resource limitations often hinder the early detection of CAD, particularly in regions lacking primary care and trained cardiologists. Traditional diagnostic tools such as ECG and coronary angiography are not always available and their interpretation can be subjective. Recently, non-invasive audio signal processing techniques using heart sound data, such as phonocardiograms (PCGs), have been explored for the diagnosis of CAD. These heart sounds, reflective of cardiac mechanical activity, are complex and traditionally challenging to interpret. To improve accuracy, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to analyze heart sound data, identifying CAD patterns even in the early stages. 

An angiogram is a diagnostic medical imaging technique that is used to visualize blood vessels and organs, especially to identify blockages or abnormalities in the coronary arteries. It involves injecting a contrast dye and taking X-ray images. Despite its effectiveness, the technique has several limitations, including:

    1. Invasiveness: Angiography involves inserting a catheter into a blood vessel and threading it to the heart, with dye injection and X-rays that can cause allergic reactions, kidney damage, or infections.

    2. Cost: Angiograms are expensive, typically ranging from INR 50,000 to INR 2,50,000 which is prohibitive for many.

    3. Limited Access: In rural or underserved areas, especially in countries such as India, medical facilities equipped to perform angiograms are rare.

    4. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, headaches, and a warm sensation. Allergic reactions can range from mild rashes to difficulty breathing. In rare cases, the dye can affect kidney function, especially in those with pre-existing conditions. 

In rural India, a 2017 Public Health Foundation India (PHFI) study [2] found that the prevalence of CAD has nearly doubled in 25 years. However, few people can access advanced diagnostics such as angiography due to logistical and financial constraints.

------------------------------
2.1 Need for an Alternative Technology
------------------------------
Traditional angiography has limitations, highlighting the need for an alternative that is:
  - Non-invasive, 
  - Affordable, 
  - Accessible to rural and low-income populations, and 
  - Capable of early detection.
  
Team CardioSonic proposes an electronic stethoscope, AngioScope, to detect blood vessel blockages through heart sound analysis, signal processing, and machine learning, revolutionizing cardiovascular diagnostics. This innovation will lead to:

    1.  Increasing Access to Rural Populations: Rural healthcare infrastructure is a global issue. In India, over 60% of people live in rural areas, but 80\% of cardiologists are in cities. The World Economic Forum (2019) reported that over 60 million Indians have heart disease, often diagnosed too late due to limited facilities. The portable and affordable AngioScope device can be deployed in mobile clinics or primary care in rural regions, enabling early detection of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and reducing fatal heart attacks and strokes.


    2. Early detection of arterial blockages through non-invasive methods is vital in reducing mortality. Devices like AngioScope, which analyze heart sounds to detect blockages, present a viable alternative to conventional angiography. These tools make early diagnosis more accessible and affordable, especially in areas with limited healthcare infrastructure. By addressing blockages early, such innovations could save millions of lives globally.

    3. Globally, health inequity is a significant problem even in developed countries such as the United States, where access to healthcare is often tied to income, low-income populations are 25\% more likely to suffer from heart disease, but have limited access to diagnostic tools such as angiograms. With India rising in the ranks of developed countries, devices such as AngioScope can bring health equity to a global platform.


------------------------------
3. CARDIOSONIC SOLUTION
------------------------------

------------------------------
3.1 Technology Background
------------------------------

The heart's rhythmic valve activity creates distinct sounds. In cardiovascular disease (CVD), arterial blockages alter blood flow and heart sounds, which is useful for diagnosing CVD. The disease causes turbulent blood flow and unusual heart sounds, which help detect and assess blockages [3].
Historically, medical professionals have used auscultation, a clinical method of listening to internal body sounds through a stethoscope, to detect cardiac disorders. However, this process is highly dependent on the experience and skill of the physicians. Cardiologists achieve about 80% accuracy [4], while general physicians have an accuracy of 20% to 40% [5]. Computer-aided analysis using signal processing and machine learning has significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy of general physicians.

The critical features of heart sounds relevant to CVD detection include:

    1. Intensity and Amplitude Variations: CVD can cause weak or inconsistent heart sounds due to reduced blood flow. Analyzing the amplitude of heart sounds helps detect these subtle changes.

    2. Pitch and Frequency Shifts: Blockages can cause high-frequency sounds or murmurs from turbulent blood flow in narrowed arteries, which audio-processing techniques can capture.

    3. Timing and Abnormal Durations: In CVD cases, the timing between two heart sounds can deviate due to delayed or blocked blood flow. Detecting these anomalies is crucial to identifying blockages.

    4. Presence of Murmurs: CVD blockages can cause systolic or diastolic murmurs, abnormal heart sounds from turbulent flow. These murmurs indicate arterial narrowing and can be analyzed with advanced audio signal processing.

Although the above sound characteristics are known to be very relevant in detecting CVD issues, it is very subjective in nature for a human to listen and diagnose with confidence. Therefore, using a large dataset to train a neural network will remove a lot of subjectivity while being able to discern the above features.

------------------------------
3.2 Idea Description
------------------------------

Team CardioSonic proposes an AI-based electronic stethoscope, AngioScope, that can detect blockages in blood vessels, satisfying the desire for a low-cost, non-invasive alternative to conventional angiography. Real-time digital heart sound data from a conventional electronic stethoscope will be processed using Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to detect blockages in blood vessels with more than 90% accuracy. 

In the proposed method, we will use an electronic chest piece as in a conventional electronic stethoscope. The electronic chest piece converts sounds from the heart to a digital stream using transducers such as microphones and accelerometers. 

The typical procedure for classifying heart sounds consists of three main steps: 1) signal conditioning, 2) extraction of spectral features, and 3) classification [6][7]. This method is a proven method in the audio world, specifically keyword spotting (KWS) [8]. For signal conditioning, the digitized heart sound undergoes an optional high-pass filter (HPF) to eliminate any DC components in the signal. Subsequently, the signal is segmented and windowed (preferably with a Hanning window) to prevent spectral leakage, which is a distortion of the frequency transform of the signal.  The linear spectrum is transformed into a Mel scale for better computing efficiency using the following equation Mel(f) = 2595*log(1 + f/700) [9].

Subsequently, the logarithm of the Mel frequency power is computed followed by the discrete cosine transform (DCT) to generate the spectral features known as the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) \cite{han2006efficient}. These coefficients are used to train a neural network classifier, such as a convolution neural network (CNN), using a already known dataset with known medical conditions. Once the training is completed, it can now be used to test unknown heart sounds and diagnose them with the accuracy trained. 

------------------------------
3.3 Modeling And Training for Feasibility and Viability Analysis
------------------------------

The proposed solution has been modeled using the Python programming language. For the classifier, a CNN is modeled using popular AI Python tensorflow and sklearn libraries. To train the neural network, we use data sets specifically for blood vessel blockages from a popular database, the 2016 Challenge Database of PhysioNet Computational Cardiology (CinC) [10].

3.3.1 About the Dataset
------------------------------

This dataset is one of the largest publicly available collections for automated classification of heart sounds, focusing on normal vs. abnormal detections. It supports the development of robust algorithms for classifying heart sounds in various clinical and non-clinical environments. The dataset's variability in recording quality, heart conditions, and demographics makes it a valuable resource for healthcare machine learning applications.

The dataset includes heart sound recordings from hospitals, clinics, and home visits. Digital stethoscopes placed in the aortic, pulmonic, tricuspid, and mitral areas of the chest collected the data. These locations are ideal for detecting murmurs, clicks, or extra heartbeats. The recordings range from 10 to 60 seconds and include both healthy individuals and heart patients.

Each recording is labeled as "normal" or "abnormal", according to expert evaluations, and suitable for supervised machine learning. The data set also includes information on the age, gender, and location of the patient's recording, although the main focus of the Challenge is classifying heart sounds.

3.3.2 Training the Neural Network
------------------------------

The PhysioNet Challenge dataset is widely used for building machine learning models to classify heart sounds into normal and abnormal categories. Typically frequency-domain spectral features are extracted and the neural network (eg. CNN) are trained as explained in the previous section.

3.3.3 Technologies Used
------------------------------

Software:
---------

Python and Machine Learning Libraries: Python serves as the core language for developing machine learning models due to its rich ecosystem of libraries and ease of use. For this project, key libraries include:

   - Librosa: Used for audio processing and feature extraction. Librosa provides tools for tasks such as filtering, segmentation, and calculating Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).

   - TensorFlow: Used for developing and training deep learning models like CNNs. TensorFlow’s flexibility and GPU support are ideal for large datasets and complex architectures.

   - Scikit-learn: Employed for classical machine learning tasks such as feature scaling,  

   - Digital Signal Processing Techniques: Signal conditioning uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and MFCC extraction. FFT converts time-domain signals into the frequency domain, showing energy distribution across frequencies. MFCCs capture perceptual features of heart sounds, crucial for distinguishing normal from abnormal conditions.. 


From the dataset, about 80% of the data is used to train the neural network, and the rest are used to test the CNN after the training is complete. After about 25 iterations, or epochs, of the training algorithm, the neural network (CNN) shows a better accuracy than 92% in diagnosing the condition of blood vessel blockage. This proves the feasibility and viability of the proposed solution. The next step is to optimize the Python code for implementation in a bare metal hardware platform to keep the size and cost small.

Hardware:
---------

To create a prototype of our proposed solution, we will target two platforms in increasing order of system resources, so we end up with a solution that uses the lowest cost hardware to implement the solution:

   1. ESP32 Node MCU: 240 MHz Dual Core Xtensa, 4MB external FLash, 520 kB SRAM, built-in WiFi and Bluetooth and can be programmed in microPython, C or C++.

   2. Raspberry Pi Zero SBC: 1 GHz Arm processor, 512 MB RAM, bluetooth/WiFi and runs a full Linux OS.

Our first attempt is to optimize the Python model for microPython or C / C++ code that can be executed on a ESP32 node MCU. If the error percentage is unacceptable, we will implement our solution on Raspberry Pi Zero which has enough system resources to handle this model.

Our proposed system works in the lower audio band (less than 2kHz sampling) with an average fixed point precision, allowing us to implement it on a wide range of low-cost hardware platforms. This versatility ensures that healthcare providers, regardless of their resources, can leverage the power of CardioSonic's solution, AngioScope. This hardware diversity increases the viability of our solution.

3.3.4 Three Steps to Final Prototype
------------------------------

    Step 1: Once the model is implemented on the hardware, the input from the dataset will be provided directly to the hardware as a raw sound data file. This will ensure that the model has been implemented accurately. 

    Step 2: The next step will be to interface a digital microphone with the input, and the audio files from the data set will be played on a speaker next to the microphone with a suitable amplitude to mimic a stethoscope. This will ensure that the model can work in an acoustic environment, including ambient noise. 

    Step 3: Finally, we will interface an electronic chest piece with a transducer and an audio codec that captures heart sounds using a high-sensitivity microphone. The audio codec digitizes the analog signals and sends the data serially, which seamlessly fit from the previous step. 

------------------------------
4. POTENTIAL CHALLENGES and RISKS
------------------------------

Although the promising outcomes of CardioSonic are encouraging, several challenges and risks must be addressed to ensure successful implementation.

  1. Clinical Trials: Conducting clinical trials with diverse patient populations is challenging. A representative sample is crucial to validate the effectiveness of the system in different demographics, such as age, sex, and underlying health conditions. This diversity helps to reduce biases and improves the homogeneity of the results.

  2. Cultural Peculiarities: Variations in cardiac sounds among Indian and specific populations can lead to classification errors. Recognizing these nuances is crucial for accuracy. Collaboration with local healthcare professionals offers valuable insight.

  3. Real-World Noise: Real-world noise, often missing from training data, threatens diagnostic accuracy. Environmental factors, such as clinical background noise or rural everyday noise, can harm system performance. Identifying this issue is vital for reliable diagnoses.

  4. Resistance to adoption: Urban physicians may resist the CardioSonic solution due to the reluctance to integrate new technology, skepticism about AI, reliability concerns, and comfort with traditional methods. Overcoming this resistance is essential for widespread implementation.


------------------------------
5. STRATEGIES for OVERCOMING the RISKS
------------------------------

To effectively mitigate the identified challenges, several strategic initiatives can be employed:

    1. Mobile Medical Camps: Mobile medical camps in rural areas will demonstrate CardioSonic's efficacy and build confidence among urban doctors. These camps offer real-world exposure to the technology, showcasing its capabilities and ease of use, while collecting localized heart sound datasets to enrich training data.

    2. Noise Robustness: Using noise-resistant layers like attention mechanisms enhances system robustness against background noise, maintaining diagnostic accuracy by focusing on relevant heart sound features.

    3. Data Augmentation: Generating synthetic heart sounds addresses class imbalances (e.g., more normal sounds than abnormal). This data augmentation diversifies the dataset and improves model performance by balancing training data. Techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can create realistic synthetic samples.

    4. Continuous Feedback Loop: A continuous feedback loop with healthcare professionals provides valuable insights into CardioSonic's real-world performance, identifying areas for improvement and ensuring the technology evolves to meet user needs.

The CardioSonic initiative, grounded in a solid training foundation and adaptable technology, shows strong feasibility and viability. Despite challenges, proactive strategies in community engagement, technology, and data practices can ensure successful implementation. By overcoming these hurdles, CardioSonic could revolutionize cardiac diagnostics, improve patient outcomes, and advance healthcare technologies. With the right approaches, CardioSonic can bridge the gap between traditional diagnostic methods and innovative technology, ushering in a new era of cardiovascular care.

------------------------------
6. IMPACT AND BENEFITS
------------------------------

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), especially those caused by artery blockages like coronary artery disease, are a major global health risk. Angiography, the common method for detecting these blockages, involves injecting contrast dye and taking X-rays. Despite its accuracy, angiography is invasive, costly, and requires specialized resources, limiting its accessibility, particularly in low-income and rural areas.

The global burden of CVDs is growing. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that CVDs are the leading cause of death worldwide, causing nearly 18 million deaths annually, 85% due to heart attacks and strokes. Low- and middle-income countries account for more 75% of CVD deaths, mainly due to limited access to early diagnostics such as angiography, poor healthcare infrastructure, and high treatment costs.

Blockages often result from atherosclerosis, where fatty deposits (plaque) build up in arteries, restricting blood flow to vital organs like the heart and brain. This can lead to coronary artery disease (CAD), causing heart attacks, or cerebrovascular disease, causing strokes. Contributing factors include high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, and poor diet.

The prevalence of blockages is notable in low- and middle-income countries, where more 75\% cardiovascular deaths occur. For example, in India, the increase in CVD deaths is driven by lifestyle changes, urbanization, and limited access to healthcare. In 2016, CVDs represented 28% of all deaths in India, with the average age of onset younger than in high-income countries.

Early detection and diagnosis are crucial in preventing heart attacks and strokes. Traditional methods, such as stethoscope auscultation, are based heavily on physician experience and often require specialist referrals. Advances in digital technology and ML have led to digital stethoscopes to analyze heart vein blockages by heart sounds, promising transformative healthcare improvement in outcomes and accessibility.

Some of the key impact and benefits are:

    1. Enhanced Diagnostic Capability: Integrating machine learning with digital stethoscopes improves diagnostic capabilities for general physicians. Automated classification of heart sounds allows accurate diagnoses without specialized expertise, reducing the need for cardiologists and allowing faster diagnosis and intervention of heart vein blockages. ML models can be trained on large datasets to recognize subtle patterns in heart sounds that may be missed by the human ear.

    2. Cost-Effective: Digital stethoscopes require minimal hardware compared to devices like echocardiograms or angiograms, making them cost-effective. Combined with machine learning, they offer powerful diagnostics at a fraction of traditional costs. Reducing the need for expensive equipment, they enable more affordable care, especially in low-resource settings with limited access to advanced diagnostics.

    3. Non-Invasive and Patient-Friendly: Heart sound recordings are non-invasive, making them safe and patient-friendly. Traditional methods like angiograms are invasive and risky. Digital stethoscopes offer a painless, risk-free alternative without surgery or radiation. Their non-invasive nature is ideal for early-stage screening, allowing continuous monitoring without discomfort. This encourages regular health checks and improves patient outcomes through early detection.

    4. Reduced Healthcare Cost: ML-based digital stethoscopes can significantly reduce healthcare costs. Accurate detection of heart abnormalities reduces the need for costly diagnostics such as stress tests or angiograms, promoting healthcare systems and patients. Early detection of vein blockages can avert expensive surgeries or long-term medications. Frequent, accessible monitoring allows for early intervention, reducing long-term expenses.

    5. Accessible Quality Care for Underserved Populations: Limited healthcare infrastructure in rural and underserved areas makes access to high-quality diagnostic care challenging. Portable, easy-to-use digital stethoscopes are ideal for remote healthcare. Combined with machine learning, they enable providers to diagnose complex heart conditions without advanced facilities. By democratizing quality care, digital stethoscopes bridge urban-rural healthcare gaps, ensuring timely, accurate diagnoses and reducing healthcare disparities for underserved populations.

    6. Improved Accuracy and Precision: Machine learning models improve heart sound classification accuracy, helping even less experienced clinicians. These algorithms can detect patterns that are undetectable by the human eye, offering an objective diagnosis. This precision reduces missed heart vein blockages, allowing for timely interventions and better outcomes. Furthermore, as ML models learn from larger datasets, the diagnostic accuracy of digital stethoscopes increases, promising future advances in precision.

    7. Increased Access and Remote Monitoring: With telemedicine on the rise, remote patient monitoring is crucial. Digital stethoscopes allow patients to record and send heart sounds to home healthcare providers, improving care access, especially for those with travel difficulties. Remote monitoring of heart health enables continuous observation, early detection of abnormalities, and reduced emergency care and hospitalization costs.

    8. Reduced Physician Burden: Automating heart sound analysis with machine learning reduces physician workload, enabling a focus on complex cases. Digital stethoscopes classify heart sounds, freeing healthcare professionals from tasks that require clinical judgment, enhancing efficiency. In high-volume settings like emergency rooms or primary care clinics, this streamlines diagnostics, ensuring timely patient care without overburdening physicians.

    9. Prevention of Disease Progression: Early detection is crucial for preventing heart disease progression. Digital stethoscopes with ML algorithms allow frequent, accurate monitoring, helping healthcare providers identify issues early and implement preventive measures. This proactive healthcare approach improves patient outcomes and reduces long-term costs of advanced cardiovascular disease management.

    10. Potential for Advanced Accuracy: ML-based digital stethoscopes can serve as a pre-test to traditional methods like angiograms by accurately identifying patients at high risk of heart blockage, guiding targeted use of expensive procedures for those who truly need further tests. The integration of machine learning with digital stethoscopes improves diagnostic accuracy, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness, potentially transforming cardiovascular care to be more efficient, affordable, and widely accessible.
